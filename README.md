Crypto tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that represent an asset or specific use and reside on their blockchain.

# Services
Smart-contract, blockchain, crypto-currencies for Proof of compliance to regulatory or contractual requirements.  
Digital Certification Services (DCS).   
Certifications (witnessing, auditing, confirming) proof of compliance and continuous improvement.  
When services are provided new tokens are created which can then be owned (to show compliance) or sold (to transfer ownership).  
For example drone pilots selling their drones can transfer ownership of their DCS certificate showing the full history of their drone maintenance compliance requirements as per CAR 901.29. The new drone owner will then have the full history/provenance of the drone. 

Scope:  
Quality Management Systems (AS9100, ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO27001). Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) and Standards. SOR-96-433-901.01 Part IX â€” Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and CAR 901.29 (maintained to manufacturer's instructions).  

Public DCS: For example organisations wishing to show their "interested parties" (regulators city community citizens) that they continuously meet their environmental obligations as per ISO 14000 could buy and then publish to the general public their DCS tokens that show the history of their ISO 14000 compliance.  Another example of a public DCS is when an aerospace manufacturer publishes its FAA, TCCA, EASA type certificate or parts history/provenance to publically show its regulatory compliance. The DCS token independantly confirms an organisations' claims. The advantage (vs traditional analog paper based certifications) is that the certification information and the audit trail is now digitised on a blockchain. DCS can be thought of as a replacement for third-parties such as registrars.  

Private DCS types of token. For example an organisation wishing to show only its customers that it continuously meets its contractual or regulatory obligations. A more specific example would be an organisation operating drones the DCS can be used to show regulatory compliance to CAR901.29 and to show the maintenace history when selling its drones. Private DCS types token will have their own token and private blockchain created which the organisation can then manage and share with their customers when and how they wish. Private DCS can use the SLP or ERC-20 protocol to create their own crypto-currencies. 

Advantages: Decentralization, immutability, security, economy (lower costs less wastes), transparency (beter accessibility to the data, once digital blockchain certificates are issued interested parties can verify them without having to depend on third-parties using private centralised databases). For example drone pilots can backup their CAR901.29 records on DCS tokens and they then would never have to worry about their certification data becoming lost, damaged, corrupted, stolen.  

Data security: as per ISO 27001 (ISMS).  

Typical worflow:  
An organisation wants to digitize some of its certifications. Certification requirements are compiled, the organisation verifies and confirms they agree with the checklist. We audit the process and tokenize/document all proof of compliance (test reports, analysis, consensus on similarity, pictures or any combinations of other objective evidences) in the DCS blockchain. Any non-compliances are corrected by the customer with a root cause analysis (RCA) supporting the corrections (typically a 5 why investigation), new tokens are created to document this new work. We re-audit untill all non compliances are resolved to confirm the adequacy of the corrections and of the RCA and re-issue new DCS tokens for the now fully compliant process. The organisation can then prove, demonstrate, show to the authorities or other interested parties its compliance. Interested parties can then verify (on the blockchain) any digital certificates. DCS holders can also provide DCS tokens proving the full provenance of their products at any stage. DCS can also be used to prevent counterfeiting by establishing the full provenance of products from their design to their testing and finbally to their use in service. The organisation now owns its DCS token and may dispose of them as they wish (DCS are like a digital twin representing products and their provenance/history and can therefore be traded or sold with the product). The organisation backs up its DCS products certificates from the blockchain using their IT record keeping procedures.  

Adding messages (such as certification data) to a transaction.  
In your wallet (in this example we will use the wallet "My BCH wallet") when sending coins there will be a section named "Personal Memo" this is where the message is entered. This can be done by anyone doing a transaction. A coin miner can also add data when they find create a new block or by adding data to the coinbase parameter. The coinbase is the content of the 'input' of a generation transaction. While regular transactions use the 'inputs' section to refer to their parent transaction outputs, a generation transaction has no parent, and creates new coins from nothing. The coinbase can contain any arbitrary data. The bitcoin genesis block for example contains the dated title of a newspaper article in The Times. This was done for the first time in the [bitcoin genesis block](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) by storing the following sentence in the bitcoin block chain: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". This was probably intended as a proof that the block was created on or after January 3, 2009.  

Examples [Raw block data](MessageInAbitcoinRawData.JPG) and for a [Broken block data](MessageInAbitcoinbrokenDownData.JPG). 
For a bitcoin (BTC) transaction example. Use Blockchain.info while sending transaction go to the "custom send" tab and put any message you want to send and the transaction will be processed with the message.  

Verifying messages (such as certification data) to a token.  
In your wallet (in this example we will use the wallet "My BCH wallet") use the function "View transaction on block explorer". This will take you to the explorer.bitcoin.com blockchain and you will have 2 options "Summary" or "View details" select summary to see the basic data for this transaction select View details for all the data including the message related to this transaction.  Or When you open a block chain file with a text editor that can display ASCII characters, your message will be visible. The message will be in [ASCII table encoding](MessageInAbitcoinRawData.JPG) accompanied by much data related to the management of the blockchain but unrelated to the message. 
For a bitcoin example you can from blockchain.info view the blocks infomation with "Input Script" hash values then you can read the messages from blockchain.info.

## DCS  
DCS (Digital Certification Services) are tokens representing real-world products, services such as certifications (proof of regulatory compliance (tests, analysis, consensus on similarity)), assets, products, services. DPS can be sent/received and are issued on the BCH/SLP (bitcoin cash) network instead of running on their own blockchain.  

The DCS coin is listed on bitcoin.com [here](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/token/ee7fd620ec270e1e5856596a5d6646f02c412e8844fa16cb4e576b5409a2e9a7)

[SLP is the Simple ledger Protocol](https://simpleledger.cash) A token system for Bitcoin Cash. It is similar to the ERC-20 standard. SLP tokens can be used as representations (digital twin) of valuable real-world assets, products, services in the SLP blockchain which can be sent and received. SLP tokens (like our own DCS) are issued on the BCH (bitcoin cash) network instead of running on their own blockchain. 

## Legal

This is not financial advice and there are no warranties of any types. This section is a summary of the applicable legal and regulatory requirements for crypto currencies (CCs) and the certificaion of products. In case of conflict between this procedure and any official regulatory requirements the latter (i.e. the regulatory requirements, orders or statutes) shall always take precedence. Legal Requirements for CCs and smart contracts depend on the country where they are used. In Canada CCs are regulated under provincial securities laws. A "security" means "an investment contract" which require an investment of resources (time, money) in a business which may succeed or fail depending on the quantity and quality of the work of the business managers. This means that if you trade, buy or sell your CCs you will have profits or losses from capital gains that need to be reported for tax purposes. So for example if you are a drone operator and sell your drone and its DCS maintenance certificate showing compliance to CAR901.29 for a profit or loss you will have to report this information when you will submit your income taxes.
