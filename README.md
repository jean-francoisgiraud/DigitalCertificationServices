# Definitions 
CC = Crypto Currencies.
P2P = Peer To Peer (a replicated network of ledger-database-records the opposite of a centralised database). 
SLP = Simple Ledger Protocol (similar to ERC-20 but for BCH)   

AS9100 is a standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry. It is based on ISO9001.  
ISO 9001 sets out the criteria for a quality management system and is the only standard in the family that can be certified to (although this is not a requirement).  
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (also known as ISO27001) is the international standard that sets out the specification for an information security management system (ISMS). Its best-practice approach helps organisations manage their information security by addressing people and processes as well as technology.

Disclaimer. This is not financial advice (there are no warranties of any types).  

In case of conflict between this procedure and any official regulatory requirements puyblished by elected authorities the latter (i.e. the regulatory requirements, orders or statutes (the formal written enactment of legislative authority that govern the legal requirements)) shall always take precedence.  

Requirements depend on the country where the CC are used. see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory.  

In Canada crypto currencies are regulated under provincial securities laws.  
A “security” means “an investment contract” which require: an investment of money in a business which may succeed or fail depending of the quantity and quality of the work of the business managers.  
This means that if you buy and sell them at a profit, you have income (capital gains) that needs to be reported for tax purposes.  

## DCS  
DCS are our own tokens representing real-world certification (proof of regulatory compliance) and assets, products, services. DPS can be sent/received and are issued on the BCH/SLP (bitcoin cash) network instead of running on their own blockchain.  

The DCS coin is listed on bitcoin.com https://explorer.bitcoin.com [here](https://explorer.bitcoin.com)

## SLP
[SLP is the Simple ledger Protocol](https://simpleledger.cash) A simple token system for Bitcoin Cash. Similar to the ERC-20 standard.  
SLP is used for token implementation and is similar to bitcoin. SLP tokens are valuable real-world assets, products, services represented in the SLP blockchain which can be sent and received. SLP tokens (like our own KIP) are issued on the BCH (bitcoin cash) network instead of running on their own blockchain.
