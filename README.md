# Services
Smart-contract, blockchain, crypto-currencies for Proof of compliance to regulatory or contractual requirements.  
Digital Certification Services (DCS). Replacing previous certifications with tokens digitally signed and encrypted blockchain.  
Certifications (witnessing, auditing, confirming) proof of compliance and continuous improvement.  

Scope:  
Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) and Standards. SOR-96-433-901.01 Part IX â€” Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and CAR 901.29 (maintained to manufacturer's instructions). Quality Management Systems (AS9100, ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO27001).  

Typical worflow:  
An organisation wants to digitize a certification. Certification requirements are compiled, the organisation verifies and confirms. We audit the process and tokenize/document all proof of compliance (test reports, analysis, consensus on similarity, pictures or any combinations of other objective evidences) in the DCS blockchain. Any non-compliances are corrected by the customer with a root cause analysis (RCA) supporting the corrections (typically a 5 why investigation). We re-audit untill all non compliancs are resolved to confirm the adequacy of the corrections and of the RCA and re-issue a new DCS tokens for the now fully compliant process. The organisation can then prove, demonstrate, show to the authorities or other interested parties its compliance. Interested parties can then verify (on the blockchain) any digital certificates. DCS holders can also provide DCS tokens proving the full provenance of their products at any stage. DCS can also used to prevent counterfeiting by establishing the full provenance of a product or service from its design to its use in-service. The customer backs up its products certificates from the blockchain using their IT record keeping process.  

Public DCS: For example organisations wishing to show their "interested parties" (regulators city community citizens) that they continuously meet their environmental obligations as per ISO 14000 could buy and then publish to the general public their DCS tokens that show the history of their ISO 14000 compliance.  Another example of a public DCS is when an aerospace manufacturer publishes its FAA, TCCA, EASA type certificate or parts history/provenance to publically show its regulatory compliance. The DCS token independantly confirms an organisations' claims. The advantage (vs traditional analog paper based certifications) is that the certification information and the audit trail is now digitised on a blockchain. DCS can be thought of as a replacement for third-parties such as registrars.  

Private DCS types of token. For example an organisation wishing to show only its customers that it continuously meets its contractual or regulatory obligations. Private DCS types token will have their own token and private blockchain created which they can then manage and share with their customers when and how they wish. Private DCS can use the SLP or ERC-20 protocol to create their own crypto-currencies. 

Advantages: decentralization, immutability, security, economy (lower costs less wastes), transparency (beter accessibility to the data, once digital blockchain certificates are issued interested parties can verify them without having to depend on third-parties using private centralised databases).  

Data security: ISO 27001 (ISMS).

## Legal

Below is a brief summary of the legal and regulatory requirements, please contact us for the full terms of services.  
Disclaimer. This is not financial advice and there are no warranties of any types.  
In case of conflict between this procedure and any official regulatory requirements published by the elected authorities the latter (i.e. the regulatory requirements, orders or statutes (the formal written enactment of legislative authority that govern the legal requirements)) shall always take precedence. Legal Requirements for CCs, smart contracts and QMS depend on the country where the CCs or QMS are used. Ex See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory.  
In Canada blockchains, smart contracts and crypto currencies are regulated under provincial securities laws. A "security" means "an investment contract" which require an investment of resources (time, money) in a business which may succeed or fail depending on the quantity and quality of the work of the business managers. This means that if you trade, buy and sell CCs or operate smart-contracts you have profits and/or losses (from capital gains) that need to be reported for tax purposes.

## DCS  
DCS (Digital Certification Services) are our own tokens representing real-world products, services such as certifications (proof of regulatory compliance (tests, analysis, consensus on similarity)), assets, products, services. DPS can be sent/received and are issued on the BCH/SLP (bitcoin cash) network instead of running on their own blockchain.  

The DCS coin is listed on bitcoin.com [here](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/token/ee7fd620ec270e1e5856596a5d6646f02c412e8844fa16cb4e576b5409a2e9a7)

## SLP
[SLP is the Simple ledger Protocol](https://simpleledger.cash) A simple token system for Bitcoin Cash. It is similar to the ERC-20 standard. SLP tokens are representations (digital twin) of valuable real-world assets, products, services represented in the SLP blockchain which can be sent and received. SLP tokens (like our own DCS) are issued on the BCH (bitcoin cash) network instead of running on their own blockchain.
